# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
I struggled when it asked us to combine arrays and objects, but once I figured it out, I realized it was not too complicated.
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
Note taking is going well. I believe that keeping my notes organized is most helpful. I take the most helpful notes when I'm reading the assignment details by myself, and going at my own pace. When I try to take notes during the live session, I find it hard to actually take in everything that the teacher is saying while taking good notes, but I will jot down a few important things the teacher says.
- What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
I try to solve the problem on my own first, then google, then slack.
